# Random Number Guessing Game

This is a quick project to practice using JavaScript to create a guessing game that requires the user to guess a random number, and gives both written and color-coordinated feedback.

## Credits

This project was created as a part of a [Traversy Media JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/).

## Dependencies

[Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com) was used for the styling of this particular page.

## Adjustments

My JS provides the same functionality, but has a few differences, so any bugs and errors are my own.
